# linter-puppet-linting

This Atom/Pulsar package is the new home of AtomLinter/linter-puppet-lint. That package was no longer able to be maintained due to lack of administrator permissions to fix the continuous integration tests and/or bypass the protected branch status. Therefore I have migrated the package I formerly maintained there to its new home here.

This package provides linter support for your Puppet manifests in Pulsar using Puppet-Lint.

This package is now in maintenance mode. All feature requests and bug reports in the Github repository issue tracker will receive a response, and possibly also be implemented (especially bug fixes). However, active development on this package has ceased.

## Installation
The `puppet-lint` gem must be installed. The minimum supported version of `puppet-lint` is 2.1.0. The Atom-IDE-UI and Language-Puppet packages are also required.

All testing is performed with the latest stable version of Pulsar. Any version of Atom or any pre-release version of Pulsar is not supported.

### Usage
- There are no special notes for using this package.
