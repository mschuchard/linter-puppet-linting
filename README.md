# linter-puppet-linting

This Atom package is the new home of AtomLinter/linter-puppet-lint. That package was no longer able to be maintained due to lack of administrator permissions to fix the continuous integration tests and/or bypass the protected branch status. Therefore I have migrated the package I formerly maintained there to its new home here.

This package provides linter support for your Puppet manifests through Atom-Linter using Puppet-Lint.
